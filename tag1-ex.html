    <div align='center'>SomeBODY once told me the world was gonna roll me. I ain't the sharpest tool in the sheeed. She was looking kindofdumb, with her finger and her thumb in the shape of an L on here forehead.Yeah, well, the years start coming and they dont stop coming. Fed with the rules I hit the ground running. Doesn't make sense not to live for fun. Your head gets smart but your brain gets dumb. So much to do, so much to see, so what's wrong with taking the back streets. You'll never know if you don't go. You'll never shine if you don't glow. Hey now, you're an allstar, get your game on, get paid, hey now, you're a rock star, get your show on, get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only shooting stars can break the moooold.</div>
