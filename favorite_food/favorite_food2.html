        <p>French fries are potatoes that have been chopped into thin strips. When perfectly made, they are crispy, light, and have just the right amount of salt. They were originally enjoyed by native tribes in northen Poland, but their traditional snack was brought into Russia, and then the rest of the world when James Madison visited the country in 1765.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>A few potatoes, however much you feel like would be nice</li>
            <li>A lot of oil. You can use any type except for olive. This will make it taste like olives and that's gross</li>
            <li>Some salt for taste</li>
            <li>Ketchup, or whatever you like on your fries</li>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash your potatos. If you don't want any skin on your potatos, now is the time to peel them.</li>
                <li>Cut your potatos into strips. The potatos will melt when in the fryer, so cut them a bit bigger than you actually want them to be. Remember to dry your fries off with a paper towel. The moisture in the potaoes will create small bubbles when you fry them, which can pop, splashing scalding hot oil everywhere!</li>
                <li>Get a pot, wok, or fryer if you have one.</li>
                <li>Pour your oil into the container. You don't need a lot, but make sure that you at least have enough oil to completely cover a fry when laid on its side.</li>
                <li>Turn on the heat, and wait until it is hot enough. You will know that it is hot enough if you can put a wet fork or spoon into the water and the water sizzles.</li>
                <li>Slowly put your fries into the oil. Make sure not to overcrowd the pot or else the starch from the potatoes will meld together with the others, and you will have an unappetizing potato blob.</li>
                <li>When the fries are a golden brown colour, take them out and onto a plate with like a bunch of paper towels, 'cause it just came out of a pool of oil. Pat your fries down with another paper towel, unless you are planning on drinking an oil and potato cocktail. </li>
                <li>Sprinkle your fries with as much salt as you want. This is recommended because not only does it taste better, but because potatoes naturally excrete a mildly carcinogenic fluid when heated. Salt will cancel the affects of the fluid when it comes in contact with it. It won't affect you short term, but if you plan on eating a lot of french fries, consult your doctor (There is medication you can take, but it is expensive and just adding salt is much tastier).</li>
                <li>Congratulations! You made yourself a batch of tradtional Polish french fries! Enjoy it with whatever topping you want. Traditionally, the Polish would add a mixture of strawberry jam and Mountain Dew, but a much more western approach is ketchup. Some other fun and surprisingly tasty ideas are sauerkraut and melted white chocolate, cocoa powder, gari (also known as sushi ginger), and Windex!</li>
