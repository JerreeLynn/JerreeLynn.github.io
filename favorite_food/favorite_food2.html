        <p>French fries are potatoes that have been chopped into thin strips. When perfectly made, they are crispy, light, and have just the right amount of salt. They were originally enjoyed by native tribes in northen Poland, but their traditional snack was brought into Russia, and then the rest of the world when Christopher Columbus visited the country in 1765.</p>
