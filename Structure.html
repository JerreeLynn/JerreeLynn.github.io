    <p>Once upon a time there was a giant hippo
 who was drinking out of a pot. the pot was huuuuuge and it was an infinite pot full of infinitte porridge. Delicious! All the hippo did forever was to drink from his huge pot of porridge. One day, an evil giraffe by the name of Carlos saw the hippo drinking from his pot. He said to himself, "yo, i really want that infinite pot of infinite porridge!" He decided that he would try and take the infinte pot full of infinite porridge even if it was the last thing he did.</p>
 <p>while the hippo was in the middle of a paticularly tasty mouthful of porridge, Carlos the giraffe came up to the hippo and smacked the infinite pot full of infinite porridge out of his mouth and onto the ground with his long giraffe neck. As Carlos the giraffe tried to pick up the infinite pot full of infinite porridge and drink some porridge for himself, he realized that there was no way that he could pick up  the pot with his feet or neck! After the hippo realized that the Carlos the giraffe has just neck-slapped  the infinite pot full of infinite porridge out of his hands, the hippo said, "Yo kid what's wrong with you?" Carlos was still trying to pick up the infinite pot full of infinite porridge but to no avail. The hippo gasped as he saw the porridge spilling out of the infinite pot of infinite porridge . "NO," he shouted, as he got down on all fours and started sprinting as fast as he could to the infinite pot of porridge. He headbutted Carlos the giraffe in his side, sending him flying. He tried to pick up the infinite pot of infinite porridge, but it was too slippery. Carlos the giraffe had by now gotten back up on his feet, and saw the hippo. Overcome with rage, Carlos the giraffe charged at the hippo. The hippo shouted, "STOP!" Carlos the giraffe stopped. "If we don't stop this infinite pot of infiite porridge from spilling porridge, then infinite porridge will spill into the valley and drown us all in lukewarm porridge!" Carkis the giraffe looked down, and indeed, he saw that he was 1 inch deep in porridge. Carlos the giraffe solemnly noddded. He knew that if he didn't pick up the infinite bowl full of infinite porridge up and stop it from spilling, the porridge would flood the entire world, and it was going to be all his fault.</p>
