	<p>Oak trees tend to produce acorns in waves. For a few years, there might not be many, and then one year, they're all over the pace. If you're inundated with acorns this autumn, make the most of your bounty by turning them into nutritious flour. Keep reading for instructions on how to make flour you can use to make pancakes and bread, or soup.
